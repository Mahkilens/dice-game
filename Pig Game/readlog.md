## 🧠 Game Rules

- Two players take turns rolling a dice.
- Each roll adds to their **current score** unless they roll a **1**.
- If a **1** is rolled, the player loses their current points and it becomes the other player's turn.
- Players can click **"Hold"** to add their current score to their total and pass the turn.
- The first player to reach **100 points** wins.
